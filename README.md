  Important parameters:
  
  In the first cell, we can change the friction coefficient, damping factors, mass, and even gravity. We can also choose to enable/disable the fiction and damping effects.
  In the last cell, the variable ***sampling*** controls the ratio of visualization samplings. For example, ***sampling = 10*** means every 1 out of 10 data points are visualized.
